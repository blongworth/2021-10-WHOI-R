  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a> aims to help researchers
  get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic
  research computing skills.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts
  and tools, including program design, version control, data management, and
  task automation.  We will be learning <a
  href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, a high-level programming language
  with great tools for data science and a vibrant community of users and
  developers. We will introduce the shell, a way of controlling the computer
  with typed commands, and git, a system for version control and collaboration. 
</p>

<p>
  We seek to provide a fun and accesible learning environment. Participants
  will be encouraged to help one another and to appply what they have learned
  to their own research problems. These workshops are sponsored by a WHOI
  Technical Staff Training Award.
